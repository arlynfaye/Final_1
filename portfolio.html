      <h3>Classroom</h3>
      <p>Close your eyes for a second and imagine the perfect classroom environment. This classroom would be a room filled with ambiance of success, independence, motivation and leadership. A student of any race, gender, learning strategy, financial situation ect. would be able to learn successfully. This student would be able to walk in, sit down and not be afraid of where they are at. They will not feel the need to be ashamed of their knowledge or lack of some. They will be motivated to attain more knowledge without hesitation. This would be my perfect classroom environment.</p>

      <h3>Computer Lab</h3>
      <p>My school computer lab is very special because it incorporates a great many of essential and useful features in itself. The lab houses more than 20 computers and the computers in the lab have the recent versions of the software. It has a hard writing surface on each computer table, so that the students have no problem while taking notes. My school computer lab also has a high speed internet with which helps us greatly in doing any research work.</p>

  <h3>School</h3>
  <p>College life is a big transition from school life. We go through a lot of changes when we enter college. Our schools were a safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. The transition to college is so sudden that youâ€™re no longer protected by your teachers and friends of your school time.College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you. You are now in a place full of unfamiliar faces where you need to mingle in. It teaches us to socialize and form opinions of our own. In college, students learn their free will and they go on to become more confident and composed.</p>
